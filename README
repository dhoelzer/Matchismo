This is a possible solution to the Matchismo assignment for the Stanford CS193P
IOS programming course.

This solution is slightly different from what's done in the course in that it
uses a card-back graphic.  It also corrects an error that exists in the sample
code given during the class with regard to a possibly array index out of bounds
issue.

It is also slightly different in that I prefer to instantiate my iVars explicitly
in some cases, like the game model, rather than lazily.  If, for some reason,
your instantiation fails, it's a pain to track down the fact that your entire
array is nil because it was never created because you never actually called
the getter.
